# Operator note — Go-only repository

This repository ships **only** the **Go** **`claudia`** binary. The former **TypeScript** gateway, **Docker Compose** stack, and **LiteLLM** service definitions have been removed in favor of **local** **`claudia`** / **`claudia serve`** with **BiFrost**.

Configuration is unchanged for operators already on **`config/gateway.yaml`**, **`tokens.yaml`**, and **`routing-policy.yaml`** — see [configuration.md](configuration.md) and [installation.md](installation.md).
